## ü™ü Local development on Windows

The default "dev" script uses Laravel Pail, which requires the `pcntl` extension (not available on Windows). Use these Windows-friendly options:

### Option A ‚Äî Composer one-liner

```powershell
composer run dev:win
```

Starts the Laravel server, queue worker, and Vite in one terminal.

### Option B ‚Äî PowerShell helper scripts

From the project root (`WebSystem_FinalProject_Group9`), run:

```powershell
./dev.ps1          # start Laravel, Vite, and queue worker
./dev-status.ps1   # show RUNNING/STOPPED status and URLs
./dev-stop.ps1     # stop all dev processes cleanly
```

If your PowerShell execution policy blocks scripts, run them like this:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File dev.ps1
```

### Notes

- Local DB defaults to SQLite. Ensure your `.env` contains:

  ```ini
  DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
  DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite
  ```

- If port 8000 is busy:

  ```powershell
  php artisan serve --port 8001
  # or
  ./dev.ps1 -Port 8001
  ```
